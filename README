This project encapsulates a Twilio presentation I've done for tech events in Madison, WI

The slides are in twilio-demo-presentation.pdf

The app_engine directory contains a deployable app that demos how SMSMyBus requests work for the SMS interface.

The sample-twiml directory contains a couple of static XML examples used in the talk
